Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 02-10-2024

Tap Game ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Tap Game mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information Collection and Use
We do not collect, use, or share any personally identifiable information while you use the Tap Game App. This means:

No personal data (e.g., name, email, phone number) is collected.
No location data or device information is collected.
The app does not track or store user activity.
2. Third-Party Services
The Tap Game App does not use or integrate any third-party services (such as analytics, advertisements, or social media platforms) that may collect or share your personal data.

3. Security
While no mobile app can guarantee absolute security, we do not collect any data. As such, there is no sensitive information stored or transferred via our app. We use commercially acceptable means to protect your experience when using the app.

4. Children's Privacy
Our app does not target children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided any personal information through our app, please contact us, and we will ensure the information is removed from our systems.
